Building on Windows using  Cygwin
=================================
Tested on Cygwin 2.10.0 under Windows 10,
with link-grammar version RC 5.5.2.

Language bindings
-----------------
The build system produces successful Python3 and Java bindings.
Other language bindings have not been tested.

For the Java bindings, install Java and Ant under Windows.
Make sure, under Windows, that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly
and `ant` is the `PATH`.


Building
--------
Install all the prerequisite tools,
Also install the desired optional libraries

Note: Installing the library `pcre2` is **required** for correct operation
since the default REGEX implementation (in libc) is not capable enough.

Use the `configure` command as outlined in the main [README](/README.md#creating-the-system).
Note that compiling with more than one concurrent process may be extremely slow.
To make sure only a single process is used supply `make ` with `-j 1`.
Also, the `make` built-in rules cause a lot of I/O and are not needed here, so
supplying `make` with the `-r` argument makes it much faster.

`$ make -r -j 1`

`$ make -r install`

The dictionaries are installed by default under
`/usr/local/share/link-grammar`.



Running link-parser
-------------------

* From the sources directory, using cmd.exe Windows console:

Note: ^Z/^D/^C are not supported when running under Cygwin!
In particular, don't press ^Z - it may crash or stuck the window.
To exit, use the `!exit` command.

      > PATH-TO-LG-CONF-DIRECTORY\link-parser\link-parser [arguments]

* Form the Cygwin shell:

Before installation (supposing no installed version yet):

      `$ PATH-TO-LG-CONF-DIRECTORY/link-parser/link-parser [args]`

After "make install" (supposing `/usr/local/bin` is in the `PATH`):

      `$ link-parser [arguments]`

To run the executable from other location, liblink-grammar-5.dll needs to be
in a directory in PATH (e.g. in the directory of the executable).

A helper BAT file link-parser-cygwin.bat is provided (currently under the
`mingw` directory) for invoking `link-parser`.

For more details, see "RUNNING the program" in the main
[README](/README.md#running-the-program).

Tests
-----
All the tests pass (the Python and C++ tests in the `tests` directory).
However, the C++ tests that involve multi-threading severely trash the
system and take very much time to complete.
