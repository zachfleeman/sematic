                 Java Bindings for Link Grammar
                 ------------------------------

These files implement Java language bindings for Link Grammar. They do
not extend the parsing algorithms already present in Link-Grammar in
any way. The allow users to call the standard link-grammar API from
Java.

These bindings do provide an additional feature, though: they can be used
in a client-server mode, so that, instead of calling the link-grammar
library directly, the parse request can be sent to a link-grammar
server, which then returns the result in JSON format, which the bindings
here are able to parse, and present the same API, as if the library
was called locally.

The shell script link-grammar-server.sh demonstrates how to run the
parser server.  Once the server is started, parses can be obtained
by using ordinary TCPIP sockets; so, for example:

   echo "text:this is a test" | nc localhost 9000

will return a JSON-encoded parse of the sentence "this is a test".
The diagram string can be obtained with:

   echo "storeDiagramString:true, text:this is a test" | nc localhost 9000

The port number 9000 is configurable; the language, dictionary path
and number of threads to use can also be specified.  See the shell
script for details.
