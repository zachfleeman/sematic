Perl bindings to Link Grammar
-----------------------------

NOTE:  These are "low-level" autogenerated bindings for perl. A superior
set of perl bindings are the `Lingua::LinkParser bindings`, which can be
found at http://search.cpan.org/~dbrian/Lingua-LinkParser/  You should
almost surely be using those instead of these, here.

See `example.pl` for a demo.

The build of the perl bindings is disabled by default.  You can enable
the perl bindings by saying:
```
   ./configure --enable-perl-bindings
```
