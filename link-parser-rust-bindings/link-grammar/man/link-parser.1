.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invoke bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBlink\-parser\fP is the command-line wrapper to the \%link\-grammar
natural language parsing library.  This library will parse sentences
written in English, Russian and other languages,
generating linkage trees showing relationships
between the subject, the verb, and various adjectives, adverbs,
etc. in the sentence.

.SH BACKGROUND
The \fBlink\-parser\fP command-line tool is useful for
general exploration and use, although it is presumed that, for the
parsing of large quantities of text, a custom application, making
use of the \%link\-grammar library, will be written.  Several such
applications are described on the Link Grammar web page (see SEE ALSO
below); these include
the AbiWord grammar checker, and the RelEx semantic relation extractor.
.PP
The theory of Link Grammar is explained in many academic papers.
In the first of these, Daniel Sleator and Davy Temperley,
"Parsing English with a Link Grammar" (1991),
the authors defined a new formal grammatical system called a
"link grammar". A sequence of words is in the language of a link
grammar if there is a way to draw "links" between words in such a way
that the local requirements of each word are satisfied, the links do
not cross, and the words form a consistent connected graph. The authors
encoded English grammar into such a system, and wrote \%\fBlink\-parser\fP
to parse English using this grammar.
.PP
The engine that performs the parsing is separate from the dictionaries
describing a language.  Currently, the most fully developed, complete
dictionaries are for the English and Russian languages, although
experimental, incomplete dictionaries exist for German and eight
other languages.

.SH OVERVIEW
.PP
\fBlink\-parser\fP, when invoked manually, starts an interactive shell,
taking control of the terminal.  Any lines beginning with an exclamation
mark are assumed to be a "special command"; these are described below.
The command \%\fB!help\fP will provide more info; the command
\%\fB!variables\fP will print all of the special commands.  These are also
called "variables", as almost all commands have a value associated with
them: the command typically enable or disable some function, or they
alter some multi-valued setting.
.PP
All other input is treated as a single, English-language sentence;
it is parsed, and the result of the parse is printed.  The variables
control what is printed:  By default, an ASCII-graphics linkage is
printed, although post-script output is also possible.  The printing of
the constituent tree can also be enabled. Other output controls include
the printing of disjuncts and complete link data.
.PP
In order to analyze sentences, \%\fBlink\-parser\fP depends on a
\%link\-grammar dictionary.  This contains lists of words and associated
metadata about their grammatical properties.  An English language
dictionary is provided by default.  If other language dictionaries
are installed in the default search locations, these may be explicitly
specified by means of a 2-letter ISO language code: so, for example:
.PP
.RS 4
.EX
.B link-parser de
.EE
.RE
.PP
will start the parser shell with the German dictionary.
.PP
Alternately, the dictionary location can be specified explicitly with
either an absolute or a relative file path; so, for example:
.PP
.RS 4
.EX
.B link\-parser /usr/share/link\-grammar/en
.EE
.RE
.PP
will run \%\fBlink\-parser\fP using the English dictionary located in the
typical install directory.
.PP
\fBlink\-parser\fP can also be used in a non-interactive mode ("batch mode")
via the \%\fB\-batch\fP option (a special command, see below):
So, for example:
.PP
.RS 4
.EX
.B cat thesis.txt | link\-parser -batch
.EE
.RE
.PP
will read lines from the file \%\fBthesis.txt\fP,
processing each one as a complete sentence. For sentences that don't have a
full parse, it will print
.br
.B +++++ error N
.br
(\fBN\fP is a number) to the standard output.
.PP
Alternately, an input file may be specified with the \%\fB!file\fP \fIfilename\fP
special command, described below.
.PP
Note that using "batch mode" disables the usual
ASCII-graphics linkage printing. The input sentences also don't appear by
default on stdout.  These features may be re-enabled via special
commands; special commands may be interspersed with the input.
.PP
Instead of specifying \fB-batch\fP in the command-line, \fB!batch\fP can
be specified in the said input file.
.PP
For more details, use \fB!help batch\fP in \%\fBlink\-parser\fP's
interactive shell.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print usage and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print program version and configuration details, and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-quiet
Suppress the version messages on startup.

.SS Special "!" commands
The special "!" commands can be specified as command-line options in the
command-line, or within the interactive shell itself by prefixing them with
"!" on line start.  The full option name does not need to be used; only enough
letters to make the option unique must be specified.
.PP
When specifying as a command-line option, a special command is proceeded
by "-" instead of "!".
.PP
Boolean variables may be toggled simply by giving the \%\fB!\fP\fIvarname\fP,
for example, \%\fB!batch\fP.  Setting other variables require using an
equals sign: \%\fI!varname=value\fP, for example, \%\fB!width=100\fP.
.PP
The \%\fB!help\fP command prints general help. When issued from
the interactive shell, it can get an argument, usually a special command.
The \%\fB!variables\fP
command prints all of the current variable settings.  The
\%\fB!file\fP command reads input from its argument file.  The \%\fB!file\fP
command is \fInot\fP a variable; it cannot be set.  It can be used
repeatedly.
.PP
The \%\fB!exit\fP command instructs \%\fBlink\-parser\fP to exit.
.PP
The exclamation mark "!" is also a special command by itself, used to inspect
the dictionary entry for any given word (optionally terminated by a subscript).
Thus two exclamation marks are needed before such a word when doing so from the
interactive shell. The wildcard character "*" can be specified as the last
character of the word in order to find multiple matches.

Default values of the special commands below are shown in parenthesis. Most of
them are the default ones of the \%link\-grammar library.
.br
Boolean default values are shown as \fBon\fP (1) or \fBoff\fP (0).

.TP
.BR !bad \ (off)
Enable display of bad linkages.
.TP

.RE
.TP
.BR !cost-max \ (2.7)
Largest cost to be considered.
.TP

.br
They modify the disjunct cost of dictionary words
whose expressions contain symbolic cost specifications.

representation of its linkage above it.
.PP
.RS
The following notations are used for words in the sentence:
.IP [word]
A word with no linkage.
.IP word[?].x
An unknown word whose POS category x has been found by the parser.
.IP word[!]
An unknown word whose \%link\-grammar dictionary entry has been assigned
by a RegEx.
(Use !morphology=1 to see the said dictionary entry.)
.IP word[~]
There was an unknown word in this position, and it has got replaced,
using a spell guess with this word, that is found in the \%link\-grammar
dictionary.
.IP word[&]
This word is a part of an unknown word which has been found to consist
of two or more words that are in the \%link\-grammar dictionary.
.IP word.POS
This word found in the dictionary as word.POS.
.IP word.#CORRECTION
This word is probably a typo - got linked as an alternative word CORRECTION.
.PP
For dictionaries that support morphology (enable with !morphology=1):
.IP word=
A prefix morpheme
.IP =word
A suffix morpheme
.IP word.=
A stem

case, the number of run-on corrections (word split) of unknown
words is not limited.
.TP

.RI \[bu]\  "./"
.br
.RI \[bu]\  "data/"
.br
.RI \[bu]\  "../"
.br
.RI \[bu]\  "../data/"
.br
\[bu]\  A custom data directory, as set by the API call \%\fBdictionary_set_data_dir()\fP.

.sp 2
* This location is displayed as DICTIONARY_DIR when the \%\fB\-\-version\fP
argument is provided to \%\fBlink\-parser\fP on the command line.
On windows it may be relative to the location of the \%link\-grammar library DLL;
in that case the actual location is displayed as "System data directory" when
\%\fBlink\-parser\fP is invoked with -verbosity=4.
